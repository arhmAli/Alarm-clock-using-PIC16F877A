# Alarm-clock-using-PIC16F877A
<ul>
<li>
My 4th semester final project for embedded systems pyschomotor evaluation
</li>
<li>
Alarm clock using a PIC16F877A microcontroller, an I2C protocol, and a DS3231 RTC module to keep track of time
</li>
<li>
Code is written in C language and before using should be compiled in MPLABXIDE.
</li>
<li>
The code initializes the I2C protocol and the DS3231 RTC module, sets the time and date on the RTC module, and then displays an intro message on the LCD.
</li>
<li>
The main loop of the code continuously reads the current time from the RTC module, updates the values on the LCD, and checks if the middle button has been pressed to set the alarm. If the middle button is pressed
